# Archived: Postgres migration

Postgres migration instructions have been archived and Postgres-related scaffolding has been removed from the active workflow per the current project plan. This project now uses SQLite (`./smarthelper.db`) for persistence.

If you later decide to migrate to Postgres, you can restore this file from git history or ask me to recreate migration steps and scripts.
